Protocol
--------

1. Every command is a Python function.
2. A command can accept specific arguments.
3. The argument called 'inp' represents an equivalent to stdin. This argument 
   must be an iterable that yields strings. One string represents one line. Line
   breaks are not included.
4. Every command instance is an generator that yields strings. These strings 
   represent an equivalent to stdout and stderr. Every string represents one 
   line. Line breaks are not included.
5. Every string that is yielded by a command is an instance derived from 
   basestring. It has attributes that make it possible to determine if it is
   a line for stderr or stdout.
6. A command must not raise an exception.


Open questions
--------------

1. How are return-codes handled? It must be possible to return a code for error
   or success.
